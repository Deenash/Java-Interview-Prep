}
//Points about static

//Class variables are static variables
//Instance variables are those non static variables that are declared/initialized inside a class but not inside methods 

//STATIC METHODS CANNOT BE OVERRIDEN because 
//The point of polymorphism is that you can subclass a class(create a child class for the parent class)and the objects implementing 
//those subclasses will have different behaviors for the same methods defined in the
//superclass (and overridden in the subclasses). A static method is not associated
//with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable.

//You cannot use static methods inside interface because inside interface you do not
//provide method definitions and every method needs to be overridden in the class
//that implements the interface.
//Static methods cannot be overridden as we saw above

//Scenarios to use static methods
// 1. If you are writing utility functions
// 2. If you are sure that method functionality is not going to change
// 3. You do not have to create an object
// 4. JVM optimizes static methods
// 5. Static methods are shared between objects

// Static 

//In short static variables cannot be initialized or declared inside a static method or even non - static method
// Static methods can be initialized/declared only inside a class
//In a non-static method, you can use and update static,non-static variables and local variables.
//In a static method,you can use and update static variables,local variables but not NON-Static variables.
